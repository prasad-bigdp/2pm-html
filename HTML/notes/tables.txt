Tables in HTML : Tables in HTML are used to represent the data in rows and columns.The horizontal ones are called rows and the vertical ones are called columns.
  The whole table is represented between 'table' element
  Each row uses 'tr' tag
  Each column uses 'td' or 'th' tag(table data or table heading)
  <table>
    <tr>
       <th>name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td>PRASAD</td>
    </tr>
  </table>


  To combine rows or columns, we can use rowspan or colspan
  to the first element.

  you can mention captions to Tables using caption tag.

  we can also provide general elements to make search engines understand the code easily such as thead,tbody,tfoot.
