Forms in HTML : 
    Forms are the way to collect user's Input and transform the data between client and server
    eg: login, registration,contact, feedack , address, application, payment etc..,''
    Every form is enclosed by 'form' element with the following attributes:
    i. action : action is the oath or file to which submitted dara will get passed.
    2. method : method is the way to send the data to server.
    There are two types of methods such address
       get : get is used to get the data in the URL
       post : it also sends data to specific page but it will not include in URL.

Every form contains inputs to collect the data and buttons to submit the form
  <form>
     <input type = "text">
     <button>submit</button>
  </form>

Inputs are self closing tags and they contain attributes like
