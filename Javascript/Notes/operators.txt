Operators : Operators are used to perform operations between operands. There are different kinds of Operators such as
   i. unary Operators : it uses only one operand
      eg: a++
   ii.Binary Operators: it used atleast two Operands
      eg: a+b, a-b
  iii. Ternary Operators (or) Conditional Operators:
       it uses three  operands 
     eg: let x = (5 > 3) ? 5 : 3;
     
Different Operators:
  1. Arithematic Operators:
        + -- used for addition
        - -- used for subtraction
        * -- used for multiplication
        / -- used for division eg: 1/3 = 0.33333
        % -- used for remainder eg: 1%3 = 1
        ** -- used for power eg:2**3 = 8


 2. Logical Operators:
      && -- Logical AND -- will be true only if all conditions are true
      || -- Logical OR -- will be true if any one condition is true
      ! -- Logical NOT -- will be true if actual conditions is false


 3. Relational Operators:
      >  -- greater than
      <  -- less than
      >= -- greater than or equals to
      <= -- less than or equals to
      == -- used to check whether values are equal or not (2 == '2' -- true)
      === -- used to check whether values and datatypes are equal or not 
             (2 === '2' -- false )
      !=  -- used to check whether values are not equal or equal (2 != '2' -- false)
      !==  -- used to check whether values and datatypes are not equal or equal (2 !== '2' -- true)

    4. Assignment Operators : These Operators also called as shorthand Operators
      a += 2 ===> a=a+2;
      a-=2 ==>a=a-2;
      a*=2 ==> a=a*2;
      a/=2 ==> a=a/2;
      a%=2 ==> a=a%2;
      a**=2 ==> a=a**2;
      Even '=' is also assignment operators which is used to assign a value

    5. Increment and decrement Operators: These Operators are used to increase or decrease a value by 1
    There are two variations such pre increment and post increment
     pre-increment : it will first update the value and then returns the value
     let a= 10;
     let x = ++a;
     console.log(x) //11

     post increment : it will first returns the value and then updates the value
     let a= 10;
     let x = a++;
     console.log(x) //10
     similar for pre decrement and post decrement also
 
  6. unary '+' : it is used to convert strings to numbers
  eg: 5 + +'4' = 9
