Loops : Loops are used to iterate certain statements again and again until the condition is false
  Basically loops repeats certain statements
Every loops contains initialization , condition and updation

There are two kinds of loops such as 
   i. Entry control loops
   ii. Exit control loops

i. Entry control Loops : These loops are used to check the condition at the starting of the loop and only if the condition is true, it allows inside the loop
   Eg:  while, for

ii. Exit control Loops : These loops are used to check the condition at the ending of the loop and only is the condition is true,  it will re iterate 
   Eg: do while

For Eg: There is an unlimited buffet
       condition : paid & HUNGRY
       statement :  get the food

while : while is an entry control loop which is used to iterate statements using initialization , condition and updation in three different places
 syntax: 
     initialization;
     while(condition){
        //statements
        updation;
     }

     eg: let i =0 ;
     while(i<=10){
        console.log(i);
        i++;
     }

do while: do while is an exit control loop which is used to check the condition at the ending of loop using initialization, condition and updation in three different places
  syntax: initialization; 
         do 
          {
            //statements;
            updation;
          }while(condition);
  eg :  let i = 1;
        do{
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }while(i<=10);

FOR lOOP:
    for loop is an entry control loop which is used to iterate certain statements using, while, do while and for in the same line
   syntax: for(initialization;condition;updation)
   {
      //statements;
   }
  // write a js code to print number 1 to 20 in reverse order
    for(let i=20;i>=1;i--)
    {
     console.log(i);
    }

// write a js code to print odd numbers from 1 to 20 using for loop

 for(let i =1;i<=20;i++)
 {
   if(i%2==1)
  {
   console.log(i);
  }
}


// write js code to print following pattern
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4


let arr = [8, 5, 4, 6, 1];
// print array elements using for loop
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
{
    console.log(arr[i],i)
}

//JS provides default ways to traverse array
//for.. of
for (let i of arr)
{
    console.log(i,arr.indexOf(i));
}
//for.. in
for (let i in arr)
{
    console.log(i, arr[i]);
}

for..of and for..in are predefined methods/loops which are used to iterate the array value or address from starting to ending.
