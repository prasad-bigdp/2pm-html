Object: Object is used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities(Key - value pair). It is a fundamental building block in JavaScript. In JavaScript, almost everything is an object, including arrays, functions, and even primitive data types like strings and numbers when they are treated as objects.
eg: let obj = {
    name:"Prasad",
    age:55,
    email:"a@a.com"
}
There are two ways to access any object value like
1. dot method
    console.log(obj.name); //Prasad
2. index signature
    console.log(obj["name"]); //Prasad

Objects provide methods such as :
   Object.keys(objectName)  -- returns an array of object keys
   Object.values(objectName) -- returns an array of object values
   Object.create(objectName) -- it creates new object with existing object as parent. it automatically can access parents properties called as "Prototype Inheritance"
   Object.seal(objectName) -- it restricts objects such that it cannot add a property but can change the existing property
   Object.freeze(objectName) -- it restricts objects such that it cannot add a property and cannot change the existing property
   let obj = {
    name : "prasad",
    fun : function(){
        console.log("HII")
    }
   }
 Deep and Shallow Copy: when you copy an object or array, we can use deep or shallow copies
    A shallow copy creates new array or object and copies the references of original elements
 Deep copy:
    A Deep copy creates new object or array and copies the values of original elements 

Document Object Model(DOM):  There is an object called 'document' provided by Browser which contains complete HTML and CSS of a webpage. The document is stored in the browser and display the page
JS can access document object and manipulate the elements. 
Document objects stores elements, attributes in the form of tree called DOM tree . 

DOM Selection:  We can Select HTML elements in javascript using document object with following methods
   i. getElementsByTagName('tagName') : it will all elements of specific tag name and returns a HTMLCollection Array.
   const k = document.getElementsByTagName('h1');
console.log(k[0]);
console.log(k[0].textContent)
k[0].textContent = "Bye world"


  2.  getElementsByClassName('className') : It is used to select multiple elments with a class name and it return an HTMLCollection Array
  const ele = document.getElementsByClassName('link');
ele[0].href = "https://www.instagram.com"

  3. getElementsById('id'): it is used to select a single element with specific id. it returns only the element;
  <a href="https://www.google.com" id="link">click me</a>
  const link = document.getElementById('link');
link.href="https://www.quora.com"

  4. querySelector('query') : it is used to select first element that satisfies the query
  <a href="https://www.google.com" id="link">click me</a>
  const link = document.querySelector('.link');
link.href="https://www.quora.com"

  5. querySelectorAll('query'): it is used to select all elements that satisfies the query
  const y = document.querySelectorAll(".para")
console.log(y)


DOM manipulation: After selecting elements using DOM selectors, we can manipulate it using below attributes
    i. textContent : it is used to change the text inside the element.
    ii. innerText : it is also used to change the text inside the element but in case of hidden elements it cannot access value since it respects CSS
    iii. href/src : These attributes are used to change particular elements attributes
    iv. style : it is used to update styles of an element
    v. innerHTML : it is used to update HTML code inside an element
    vi. classList : it is used to add /remove/toggle classnames to an element
    vii. value : it is used to accept/update the value of HTML Input elements

DOM creation : we can create elements from javascript using 'document' object with following method
     document.createElement('elementName');

we can append/add this element into HTML DOM tree using methods
     append(elements) or appendChild(element)
