Events : Events are the User actions on a web page which triggers a particular function or block of code.
We can add Events to a partcular element in two ways
   i. Event Handler
   ii. Event Listener

i. Event Handler: Event Handlers attach 
event to a function in HTML. usually they starts with 'on'
   eg: onclick, onsubmit, onmouseover etc..,

ii. Event Listener : Event Listeners attach event to a function in JS. They use callback functions for event trigger. They also support event propogation
  syntax: element.addEventListener('event name', callback function)
  We can also remove events using remove Event Listener

  Event Listners passes one default object to the callback function called 'event object'

Different Types of Events : Based on user's actions , events are divided into multiple types such as
   i. Mouse Events: These events are triggered by mouse actions.
   Eg: click,dblclick, mouseover,mouseout,mouseup,mousedown etc..,
   
  ii. keyboard Events : These events are triggered by keyboard actions
    Eg: keyup, keydown, keypress
   
  iii. Form Events : These events are triggered by Form actions such as submitting a form, input into a form, selecting some field in form etc..,
  eg: submit, change, input, select etc..,

  iv. window Events : These events are triggered by complete browser/window actions such as 
   'reload','load','scroll' etc..,
  

Event Propogation : Events can even propogate from parent to child or child to parent called Event Propogation. we can stop it using 'stopPropogation' method. Usually, Event Propogation is of two types
   i. bubbling
   ii. capturing
   
i. bubbling: This is default event propogation in which events propogate from innermost child to outermost child.
