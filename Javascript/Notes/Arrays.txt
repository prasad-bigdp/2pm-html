Arrays : Array is a collection of items. Arrays are represented by square brackets and each element in the array will have an address called 'index'. indexes starts from zero
let a = ["raj",1,true];
let arr = [5,4,8,9,0,-3];
console.log(arr[1]); //4
console.log(arr.length) //6
console.log(arr[23]);  //undefined

Array Methods : 
    There are numerous array methods such as
    i. push(values): it is used to add elements at the end of the array
             ArrayName.push(value1,value2,......)

    ii. pop() : it is used to remove the last element of the array
             ArrayName.pop();
    
    iii. unshift(values): it is used to add elements at the starting of the array
             ArrayName.unshift(value1,value2,....)

     iv. shift() : it is used to remove the first element of the array
             Array.shift();

      v. splice(starting_index_number , deleteCount , inserting_values):
          it is used to add elements at any index values or delete multiple values from any index value
         let names = ["raj","shyam","shekhar","john","sita"]
         i. delete "shyam" and "shekhar"
              names.splice(1,2)
            
         names = ["raj","shyam","shekhar","john","sita"]
         i. delete "shekhar" and add "raja","puja", "maaja"
              names.splice(2,0,"raja","puja", "maaja")

  TasK :  let friends = ["sheldon","monica","joey","rachel","ross","penny"];
      1. remove sheldon and add "chandler" // friends.splice(0,1,"chandler")
      friends.shift();friends.unshift("chandler")
      2. remove penny and add "pheobe" // friends.splice(5,1,"pheobe")
      friends.pop();friends.push("pheobe")
      3. insert "emma" between "rahcel" and "ross" 
         friends.splice(4,0,"emma")

   6. indexOf(element): it is used to return the index of element's first occurence in given array
        let arr =[5,4,3,8,4,7];
        console.log(arr.indexOf(4)) //1
        console.log(arr.lastIndexOf(4)) //4

   7. reverse : it is used to reverse the given array
          let arr = [1,2,3,4];
          arr.reverse();
          consoel.log(arr); //[4,3,2,1]

   8.  join : it is the opposite of split in string methods
      ["raja","prasad"].join(" "); // raja prasad

Task :  reverse the given sentense
"Easy So is Javascript"
let str = "Easy So is Javascript"
str.split(" ").reverse().join(" ")

   9.  forEach (callback(ele,ind)):
          ForEach will take a callback function and pass that callback function
          for each and every element of the array
          ArrayName.forEach(function(ele,ind){
               //body
          })
          forEach cannpt return the values;
     let arr = [5,4,3,2,1] . print squares of each element
          arr.forEach(function(e,i){
               console.log(e*e);
          })
     but if i tried to return elements whose value is greater than 2
         let x=  arr.forEach(function(e,i){
               return ele>2
          })
          console.log(x) // undefined

   10. map : map also used to traverse the array and pass a callback to each and every element of the array but map returns the values as a new array
    ArrayName.map(function(ele,ind){
     return data;
    })
    let names = ["John","Peter","Ram","Krishna"];Return First Letters of all
    the names as a new array
    let y = names.map((ele,ind)=> ele.charAt(0))
    console.log(y) //['J','P','R','K']
    names = ["shinchan","mexi","Himawari"] .Return only the names that ends with  'i' 
    let z = names.map((ele,ind)=>{
     return ele.endswith('i')
    })
    console.log(z) //[F,T,T];

  Filter : filter is used to return elements (specific) whose condition is true
  it works similar as map but return only true elements
   
 let z = names.filter((ele,ind)=>{
     return ele.endswith('i')
    })
    console.log(z) //["mexi","Himawari"]

  Find : it is used similarly as filter but returns only the first element that satisfies the condition

 let z = names.find((ele,ind)=>{
     return ele.endswith('i')
    })
    console.log(z) //"mexi"

    we can also get last occurence using FindLast

  some: it is also used similarly as filter but returns true/false based on whether atleast one of the element satisfies the condition or Not.
   let z = names.some((ele,ind)=>{
     return ele.endswith('i')
    })
    console.log(z) //true

   Every: it is also used similarly as filter but returns true/false based on whether every element satisfies the condition or Not.
   let z = names.every((ele,ind)=>{
     return ele.endswith('i')
    })
    console.log(z) //false
  
   sort(): sort is used to sort out elements as alphabetically. In case of numbers , we can pass callback to return values for ascending or descending order
