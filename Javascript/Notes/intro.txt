for house, we need 
   walls, doors, land, windows etc.., -- structure of the house  -- HTML
   decorate, paint , design --- designing of the house -- CSS
   electricity, water, gas -- functionalities of the house -- JS

Javascript runs in the Browser because every browser provides a JS engine to run Javascript.
    chrome --- v8
    mozilla --- spiderMonkey
    edge --- chakra

Browsers also Provide some default methods and some tools to inspect and debug the website called Developer tools. 
Mostly , we use console(one of the developer tools) to debug the Javascript code.
