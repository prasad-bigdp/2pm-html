CSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. it is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. it was introduced in 1994 . Each file of css is called a sheet.
CSS can be applied to HTML in three ways:
   i. inline styling
   ii. internal styling
   iii. External styling
i. inline Styling: This way is used  to apply styles to an element within the same line of element. it applies 'style' as a attribute
<element style="property:value;.....">content</element>
eg:  <h1 style="color: red;background-color: blue;">Hello World</h1>

ii. internal CSS: It is used to select elements using a selector and apply the styles using that selector name . it used 'style' as a element. it's better to keep internal styling in head element.
  <style>
      selector
      {
        property:value;
        .....
      }
  </style>
eg:  <style>
        h1
        {
         color: red;
         background-color: blue;
        }
    </style>

inline > internal

iii. External Styling: it is completely similar to internal but instead of style element, we create sepearate file with .css extension for styling
but we need to link the external css file to html using 'link' tag

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css file" />


inline > internal/external
Always previous styles will be overwriten by new styles called Cascading

But sometimes, we need to select specific elements, we need to identify elements using some properties.
 Basic Selectors:  
    i. tag name : we can select all elements of specific tag using tagname
    ii. class name : we can define a class name to group multiple elements. Any element can contain multiple class names and multiple elements may contain same class name

    .className{
        property:value;
    }


  iii. id : we can define an id to identify an element uniquely . No two
  elements should contain same id.

  #idName{
     property:value;
  }
