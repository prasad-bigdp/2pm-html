Box Model : Box model suggests treating every element in HTML as a BOX.
A Box contains 
    i. border
    ii. border-radius
    iii. padding
    iv. margin


i. border: border is the surrounding line of an element
     border: size shape color;
     we can even specify border-left,border-right,border-top,border-bottom separately

ii. border-radius: it is the corner radius of element. we can also give radius for individual corners
    border-radius: size;

iii. padding : it is the gap between border and content of element. it will be applied inside the Box.
      padding:size ; 
      we can also apply individual sides but padding by default increase height/width of the box, so we need to make 
      box-sizing:border-box;

iv. margin :  it is the gap outside the border of element. 
      margin:size;
      it can also be applied to individual sides
